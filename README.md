# To Do
1. Fix references parsing for reflist.
2. Try creating own list of stop words using a program.
3. Try Porter stemmer and lemitization.
4. For index format, could try 1 line per field per word instead of per doc per word.
5. Try multiprocessing and/or threading to speed up.
6. Secondary indexing, requires sorted index and separate index file per segment, probably alphabetically.
7. Remove other field data from body to reduce mem and speed up.
